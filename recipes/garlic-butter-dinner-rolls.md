Add in the bloomed yeast mixture, the cooled tangzhong mix, and the 2 room temperature eggs. Mix on low speed, scraping the sides occasionally.</li><li>When dough starts coming together, increase speed to medium-low. Gradually add butter, a tablespoon at a time, until incorporated and nothing sticks to the sides (about 5-7 minutes).</li><li>Dump dough onto an unfloured counter top, divide into two pieces, and roll each into a tight ball. Place dough into two lightly greased bowls, cover with damp towels, and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, for about one hour.</li><li>Lightly grease two 9x13 inch baking dishes. Punch dough down and dump onto an unfloured counter top, and divide into 12 equal pieces. Roll each dough piece into a small tight ball, then place into the baking dish in two 3x4 matrices. Cover with damp towels and let proof again for another 1 hour.</li><li>Preheat oven to 350F. Mix together the egg wash ingredients, then brush onto the risen rolls.
