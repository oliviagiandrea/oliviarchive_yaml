ingredients: "<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li><li>1 tbsp baking powder</li><li>1 tbsp granulated sugar</li><li>1 tsp salt</li><li>3/4 tsp cream of tartar</li><li>3/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed</li><li>1 cup milk</li>"
directions: "<li>Preheat oven to 450F.</li><li>In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and cream of tartar. Using your hands, massage in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs (be sure not to make them too fine, or the biscuits won't be flaky).</li><li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in milk. Using your hands again, stir the dough in the bowl just until it's moistened.</li><li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead it just until it holds together, about 4-5 times. Again, don't overwork it! Flatten it to about 3/4 inch thick, and use a floured cup rim to cut the dough into circles. Reroll scraps as necessary until all the dough has been cut and shaped.</li><li>Space dough circles evenly on a baking sheet, and bake for 10-14 minutes or until golden. Serve hot.</li>"
