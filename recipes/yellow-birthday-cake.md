Very gently fold egg whites into batter and mix JUST until incorporated.</li><li>Pour batter into prepared pans and spread into even layers, then bake for 30-35 minutes.

If the frosting seems too stiff, beat in water 1 teaspoon at a time until it's spreadable.</li><li>When cakes are completely cooled, frost one layer with about 1/3 of the chocolate buttercream frosting. Stack the other layer on top, then cover the cake with the remaining frosting.</li>"
