notes: "Tiny square pan is mandatory. Adds to the flavor."
ingredientsList: ['eggs', 'granulated sugar', 'mirin', 'soy sauce']
ingredients: "<li>2 eggs</li><li>1/2 tbsp granulated sugar</li><li>1/2 tsp mirin</li><li>1/4 tsp soy sauce</li><li>pinch salt</li>"
directions: "<li>Use a fork to whisk all ingredients together in a small bowl. They need to be totally homogenized so your eggs cook evenly.</li><li>Heat a square frying pan over medium heat with some olive oil, using a paper towel to wipe off excess. You'll know it's hot enough when a thin line of egg mixture drawn onto the pan cooks immediately.</li><li>Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the hot pan, tilting the pan to spread. Pierce any large bubbles that form. Once the thin layer is cooked through (no more liquid), use chopsticks or a spatula to gently fold the egg crepe up onto itself to form a small roll.</li><li>Push the roll to one side of the pan, re-grease the rest of the pan if needed with an oiled paper towel and pour another thin layer of the egg mixture to repeat the rolling process. Continue this until all the mixture is used up.</li><li>Once it's all cooked, flip your tamagoyaki out onto a paper towel, and roll it (pressing as you go) to shape it. Let cool for about 5 minutes before slicing into even 1-inch segments.</li>"
